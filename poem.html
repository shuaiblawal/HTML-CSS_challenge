<h1><em>Refugee Mother And Child</em></h1>
   <p>No Madonna and Child could touch</p>
   <p>that picture of a mother's tenderness</p>
    <p>for a son she soon would have to forget.</p>
    <p>The air was heavy with odours</P>
    <p>of diarrhoea of unwashed children</P>
   <p>with washed-out ribs and dried-up</p>
    <p>bottoms struggling in laboured</p>
    <p>steps behind blown empty bellies<p>
